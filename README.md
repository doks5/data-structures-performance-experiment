# data-structures-performance-experiment
Experimental setup to test performance and memory usage of different python data structures.


## Setup
To set up the experimental environment, follow the steps below.

### Clone the Project

First, clone the project locally with:

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/doks5/data-structures-performance-experiment.git
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

Then, create a python virtual environment with:
